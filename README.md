# BanknoteClassificationModel
The aim is to predict whether a given banknote is authentic or counterfeit given a number of measures taken from a photograph.



Implemented Algorithms:
1. Support Vector Machine
2. K Nearest Neighbor
3. Gaussian Naive Bayes
4. Perceptron Learning



Machine learning libraries & module:
1. Scikit learn Library
2. csv module
3. random module
